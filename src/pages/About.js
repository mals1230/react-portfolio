//           My name is Mallory Sheehan and I'm 33 years old, living in Los Angeles, California. I'm originally from New Jersey and I graduated from Penn State University in 2011. I started my career at CBS Radio in New York selling local radio advertisements on 1010 WINS and WFAN, as well as homepage takeovers and banners on cbsnewyork.com. I developed an interest in digital advertising, so after my time at CBS, I spent a year selling in-app advertising at Jun Group and most recently, I spent 4 1/2 years at AnyClip selling their proprietary A.I. video technology to digital publishers and media companies. In my free time, I love to go to concerts and travel to new places. I'm excited to be in this course and to learn how to become a developer, so that I can continue my career in tech!
